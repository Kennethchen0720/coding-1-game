Make a Basketcatcher game

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Make a Basketcatch 

Game Rules:
Colllect coins while avoiding the bombs and go as long as possible 

Major Game Elements:
Coins Bombs Human/Player possibly a shield for immunity for 5 seconds 

Gameplay Process:

Coin Emoji: U+1FA99
Bomb emoji: U+1F4A3
Basket emoji: U+1F5D1

The basket will move by A and D. 
Coins will fall by random from a set list of x positions, and will fall by a certain y position. 
Each ten coins collected will speed up the time between each coin movement by 5%.
If the coin and the basket is in the same x position, the coin will be caught and added to your score. If theyre not, the coin will be missed and you will lose 1 out of 3 lives.
There will be bombs with a 1 in 10 chance of spawning. If you catch a bomb you lose all lives.
